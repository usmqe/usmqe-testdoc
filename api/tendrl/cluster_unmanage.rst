Description
===========

Check validity of response from ``cluster/[cluster_id]/unmanage`` API call
where [cluster-id] is id of the imported cluster and check that cluster was
correctly unmanaged according to `specification`_.

Setup
=====

#. Generate *access_token*, see how to `login user`_

#. Import cluster with created volume, see :doc:`/api/tendrl/login_positive`

Test Steps
==========

.. test_action::
    :step:
        Call `List Clusters`_ API call.
    :result:
        Value of *is_managed* attribute for cluster with id [cluster_id]
        in received JSON is *yes*.
        Status of response is *200 OK*.

.. test_action::
    :step:
        Call `List Volumes`_ API call.
    :result:
        Received JSON is not empty list ``[]``.
        Status of response is *200 OK*.

.. test_action::
    :step:
        Call ``cluster/[cluster_id]/unmanage`` API call.
    :result:
        In response is message:
        ``{"job_id":"[job_id]"}`` where [job_id] is id of job that was
        generated by the API call.
        Status of response is *200 OK*.

.. test_action::
    :step:
        Repeat calling `Job Details`_ API call for [job_id] from previous
        step until there is ``"status": "finished"`` as part of the response.
    :result:
        Value of *status* attribute in received JSON is *finished*.
        Status of response is *200 OK*.

.. test_action::
    :step:
        Call `List Clusters`_ API call.
    :result:
        Value of *is_managed* attribute for cluster with id [cluster_id]
        in received JSON is *no*.
        Status of response is *200 OK*.

.. test_action::
    :step:
        Call `List Volumes`_ API call.
    :result:
        Received JSON is empty list ``[]``.
        Status of response is *200 OK*.
